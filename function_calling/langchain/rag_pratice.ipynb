      "1. 2040 서울도시기본계획의 의미Ÿ서울도시기본계획이란 ｢국토의 계획 및 이용에 관한 법률｣에 근거한 도시·군기본계획을 대도시 서울의 특성에 맞게 재구성한 ‘서울형 도시기본계획’을 의미한다.Ÿ서울도시기본계획은 ｢국토의 계획 및 이용에 관한 법률｣ 및 ｢도시·군기본계획수립지침｣에 따라 국토의 한정된 자원을 효율적이고 합리적으로 활용하여 시민 삶의 질을 향상시키고, 서울시의 지속가능한 발전을 위한 정책 방향을 제시함과 동시에 장기적으로 도시가 발전하여야 할 틀을 제시하는 종합계획이다.Ÿ2040 서울도시기본계획에서는 디지털 전환, 팬데믹, 인구변화 등에 따른 미래 도시공간 변화에 대비하여 7대 공간목표를 설정하였고, 부문별 전략계획을 통해 실효성 있는 계획체계로 개선하였으며, 토지이용계획의 지침적 성격을 강화하였다.도시기본계획이란?도시기본계획은 1981년 ｢도시계획법｣의 개정에 의해 법정화되었고, 수립목적은 토지의 이용 및 개발과 보전을 위한 국토관리의 지속가능성을 담보하는 것이다. 도시기본계획은 한정된 자원을 효율적이고 합리적으로 활용하여 주민의 삶의 질을 향상시키고, 환경적으로 건전하고 지속가능한 발전을 위한 정책방향을 제시하며, 20년 후 도시가 발전하여야 할 장기적인 틀을 제시하는 종합계획이다. 도시기본계획은 토지의 이용·개발 및 보전에 관한 관련·하위계획의 방향성을 제시하는 계획으로서, 하위계획인 도시관리계획과 타 법률에 의해 수립되는 부문별 계획이 기본계획과 일관성 있고 통일성 있게 수립될 수 있도록 지침적 역할을 하는 법정 최상위계획의 위상을 가진다.도시기본계획은 사회·경제, 환경·에너지, 교통·기반시설, 문화·복지 등 도시 전체의 다양한 분야를 포괄하는 종합계획으로서, 계획수립과정에서 시민, 전문가, 행정가 등의 다양한 의견을 폭넓게 수렴하고 조정하는 절차적 정당성이 요구되는 계획이다.' metadata={'producer': 'Hancom PDF 1.3.0.542', 'creator': 'Hwp 2020 11.0.0.5178', 'creationdate': '2024-12-12T18:16:11+09:00', 'author': 'SI', 'moddate': '2024-12-12T18:16:11+09:00', 'pdfversion': '1.4', 'source': 'data/2040_seoul_plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 205, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}\n",

Ÿ2014년에는 20년 장기적인 서울의 미래상과 발전방향을 제시하는 2030 서울도시기본계획을 발표하면서 도시기본계획의 후속계획인 생활권계획의 역할과 범위를 규정하였다.Ÿ생활권계획은 국토교통부 협의, 도시기본계획 수립지침 개정 등을 통해 별도 계획으로 수립될 수 있었고, 서울시가 생활권계획 시범도시로 선정되어 실행력을 확보할 수 있었다.Ÿ2019년 7월 ｢서울특별시 도시계획 조례｣ 개정 시 생활권계획의 수립·관리에 관한 조항을 신설하여 권역생활권계획과 지역생활권계획을 구분하고 생활권계획의 실행계획 수립에 관한 근거를 마련하였다.Ÿ이에 따라 2012년 4월에 생활권계획 수립을 착수하였고 2018년 3월, 2030 서울생활권계획을 최초로 수립하여 확정하였다.2. 생활권계획의 개념Ÿ생활권계획은 도시기본계획의 부문별 계획이자 후속계획이다.Ÿ생활권계획은 생활권역을 대상으로 지역 특성을 고려하고 주민의 다양한 의견을 파악하여 지역의 발전방향과 정책목표, 추진전략 등을 제시하는 생활밀착형 도시계획이다.-생활권이란 통근·통학·쇼핑·여가·친교·업무·공공서비스 등 주민의 일상적인 생활이 이루어지는 공간범위를 의미Ÿ지역특성을 고려하고 주민의 다양한 생활개선 요구를 담아내기 위해 주민참여를 원칙으로 서울시·자치구, 주민, 전문가 등 관련 주체가 협력하여 생활권계획을 수립한다.Ÿ생활권계획을 통해 지속적으로 제기되고 있는 생활권 간 격차뿐만 아니라 생활권 내의 격차문제를 해소할 수 있는 계기를 제공한다. 상대적으로 낙후한 생활권의 문제를 심층적으로 파악하여 전략적인 공공투자와 중점정비의 기회를 부여하고 지역별 특성을 살려갈 수 있는 특화사업을 발굴함으로써 지역균형발전에 기여한다.' metadata={'producer': 'Hancom PDF 1.3.0.542', 'creator': 'Hwp 2020 11.0.0.5178', 'creationdate': '2024-12-12T18:16:11+09:00', 'author': 'SI', 'moddate': '2024-12-12T18:16:11+09:00', 'pdfversion': '1.4', 'source': 'data/2040_seoul_plan.pdf', 'total_pages': 205, 'page': 146, 'page_label': '147'}\n",
